The flow of vehicles on roads is an intricate system influenced by numerous
factors, including infrastructure, traffic regulations, and the behavior of individual
drivers. As a result, any modifications to the structure of a road can significantly
impact its overall traffic patterns.
For our project, we have chosen to investigate the consequences of recent changes
to the structure of a particular road (36°50’07"N 10°08’04"E) on its traffic flow. By
employing a probabilistic modeling approach, we aim to understand and quantify
the effects of these alterations. Such an analysis can provide valuable insights into
the efficiency, safety, and overall performance of road systems, assisting urban
planners, transportation engineers, and policymakers in making informed decisions.
The objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, we will construct a baseline model
to represent the traffic flow on the road prior to any modifications. This model
will serve as a reference point, allowing us to gauge the changes brought about by
the structural adjustments accurately. Secondly, we will develop an updated model
that incorporates the recent alterations to the road’s design. By comparing the two
models, we can assess the extent to which the modifications have influenced traffic
behavior.
To accomplish this, we will draw upon the model used in part one, common
sense and real life data gathered through observation . In the following sections of

this report, we will present our methodology, describe the models employed, outline
the data collection and analysis procedures, and discuss the results obtained.
