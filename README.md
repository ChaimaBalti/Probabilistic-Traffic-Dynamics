# Probability Project: What Does Anarchy Bring to Our Roads?

## Overview
This project investigates the impact of anarchy on road traffic through probabilistic modeling and simulation. It examines various factors affecting collision risk and traffic flow, providing insights into how structural changes can alter traffic dynamics.

## Part I of the Project
This section introduces the concept of anarchy in traffic systems and its relevance to collision risk.

## Part II of the Project: Analyzing the Impact of Structural Changes on Traffic Flow

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChaimaBalti/Probabilistic-Traffic-Dynamics.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Probabilistic-Traffic-Dynamics
   ```
3. **Open MATLAB and run the scripts:**
   - Scripts for Part I can be found in the `Part_I` folder.
   - Scripts for Part II can be found in the `Part_II` folder.
